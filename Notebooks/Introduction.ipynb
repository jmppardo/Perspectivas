When a cell is selected you can change its type using the drop-down menu. The contents of the cell will be rendered differently according to the type of cell. To type text into the cell you must click on it and press \"enter\". It will behave as a regular plain text editor. It will highlight syntax depending on the type of cell used.\n",

After the \"raw\" cell displaying the code I will present the actual Markdown cell **with the same code** but rendered.
